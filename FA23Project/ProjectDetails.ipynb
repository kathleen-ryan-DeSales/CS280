    "\n",
    "The final project for this class will invovle an analysis on a dataset of your team's own choosing. You can choose the data based on your interests or based on work in other courses or research projects. The intent of this project is for you to demonstrate proficiency in the techniques we have covered in this class (and beyond, if you like) and apply them to a novel dataset in a meaningful way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your main goal is to prove to me that:\n",
    "* you are proficient at asking meaningful questions and answering them with the results of basic data analysis and visualization, \n",
    "* you are proficient in using Python and manipulating dataframes, \n",
    "* you are proficient at creating visualizations with seaborn, \n",
    "* you are able to apply  statistics (simulate to test hypotheses, find confidence intervals, apply regression) and \n",
    "* you are able to tell a cohesive story when you present your results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The project is very open-ended. You should create compelling visualizations of your data in Python and then interpret them. There is no limit on what tools or packages you may incorporate, but you must incorporate packages and techniques we learned in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You should expect to incorporate visualizations that we have used in class and at least one that we have not (like violin graphs, heat maps, etc) because with your Python knowledge togther with a google search for examples, you have the ability to accomplish this. \n",
    "\n",
    "* You should also use statistical technniques from class (descriptive statistics, correlations, hypothesis testing, CIs, regression).  Just talk to me about the results you're finding so we can make sure they are legitimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You do not need to visualize all of the data at once. **A handful of high quality visualizations that tell a compelling story will receive a much higher grade than a large number of poor quality visualizations that are unrelated to each other.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Also pay attention to your final write-up and presentation. Neatness, coherency, grammar, cohesiveness, and clarity will count. \n",

    "In order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is important that you choose a manageable dataset. This means that the data should be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be explored. \n",
    "\n",
    "As such, your dataset must have at least 1000 observations (so rows) and 8-12 variables (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include A MIX OF (so 2-3 at least of each kind):\n",

    "* discrete numerical variables, and  \n",
    "* continuous numerical variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  If one column is just a transform of a previous column (Example:  population with values like 4,000,000 and population in millions with values like 4), then these only count as 1 column, not 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, your data set should be in an excel file or a csv file or some type of table that can be converted to these files. If you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into Ptyhon as this can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.\n",
